adaptable, we support one another in reaching our shared goals.

## Group Agreements (Intention-Based)

 feels safe, heard, and valued. This means avoiding strong language and
 personal remarks; all feedback should be courteous and focused
 on the work — not on individuals.

that consistent participation strengthens the group.
This means we will stay present, communicate our
availability, and not disengage without notice.

because mutual respect includes showing up and being on time.
We agree not to miss entire meetings without informing
 the group and will strive to arrive punctually.

welcome and answering them is a shared effort.
Everyone should feel encouraged to seek support and
know that others will respond with patience and care.
- We intend to acknowledge that external circumstances can affect
our participation. When this happens, we will prioritize communication
 and support, reminding each other that no one has to face challenges alone.
- We understand that perfect attendance isn’t always possible.
 What matters most is our continued presence and commitment
 to the group. We will contribute actively when we can and
 support each other as circumstances allow.
- We intend to stay focused on our shared goals while remaining flexible.
We recognize that adaptability is key to navigating challenges
and staying aligned as a team.

guide us when urgent situations arise
